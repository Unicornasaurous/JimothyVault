# A collaborative effort between two noobs.
-------------------------------------------

A Jimothy owned repository that originally  
started off as a calculator; I'm myself  
trying to learn more about the full development  
cycle, so I'm sort of managing the codebase  
as I implement my own code in a practical  
and meaningful way.  


Half how-to / half show and tell, pretty much.
